### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a full-stack developer with strong interest in backend development and currently learning cloud development especially in AWS.
Main languages used are JavaScript, Node.js and TypeScript but I am always more than excited to learn something new! Current target is to improve my Python skills.
